Mercenaries are often seen as immoral soldiers driven by greed and an addiction to conflict. They are guns for hire for each and every faction, and as such, must operate on a morally grey field. But this is not to say, they would not have their own agendas or goals. Mercenary factions lack the resources or funding of the Commonwealth or the Syndicate, and do not possess any of the quirkiness of the Order of the Void or the Radical X, but they on the other hand have a lot of freedom in pursuing different agendas of their own. It may not be a level playing field, but sometimes that just makes it more interesting.
