## Advanced Regulator Corps (ARC)

When ordinary Regulators of the *Core Regulator Authority* find themselves in a situation way beyond their league, they call ARC. ARC is the elite military branch of the commonwealth, with a direct line to **Themis**, the first child, a powerful Super Intelligent Entity, and one of the *Tri-Core*. ARC is a special-ops group who wield powerful cybernetic augments and top-grade weaponry. They are promoted from the best and most promising candidates among common Regulators and being offered a spot in the ARC is a matter of great pride. ARC's primary enemy is anyone aiming to harm the Commonwealth, but they especially despise the terrorists faction **Radical X**.

### CHAOS Mk.2


ARC do not have any unique Augments, but each ARC Regulator is awarded a highly-customizable high-tech sidearm, the *CHAOS Mk. 2 Assault Sidearm*, a select-fire fully automatic handgun with advanced recoil dampening that fires 10mm programmable smart ammo and can transform in realtime to adjust for its user's needs. Each weapon is assembled by hand to their users' specifications, encoded with their quantum marker so they and only they can use the weapon. The technology is closely guarded by Themis itself, and it is not available to anyone else. Many have sought after it, but none have managed to obtain one.
