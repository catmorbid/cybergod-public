## Section 12

*Department of Education and Knowledge: Special Research Group Alpha, Section 12*. A handful of words that are easily lost in an infinite bureaucratic taxonomy of the Commonwealth's scientific branch that governs one third of the world and is managed by none other than **Gaia** the first-born, a *cybernetic god* in its own right, a Super Intelligent Entity beyond the comprehension of mere mortals, and the creator of the *Tri-Core*. Section 12 is Gaia's own creation, a super secret intelligence agency whose purpose is to combat threats beyond normal reach. They conduct morally ambiguous operations in a game of multi-dimensional chess known only to *Gaia*, and perhaps a handful of loyal operators. In Section 12 absolute loyalty is not only a requirement, but a necessity. In exchange Section 12 operatives are enhanced by advanced nano-technology built for infiltration, wielding psionic powers and body-altering augments. Section 12 favors espionage and covert operations. They wage an invisible war against the **Order of the Void**, who is their primary enemy.
