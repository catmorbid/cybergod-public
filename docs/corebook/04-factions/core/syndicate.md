## The Syndicate

The Syndicate is a global criminal organization that comes with centuries of experience from the criminal undergound. They are unified by the common goal of breaking the Commonwealth's control over individual freedoms. The Syndicate is a highly competitive organization that aims to achieve the goals dictated by its ruling *Elder Council*, through any means necessary. The Syndicate combines groups from various criminal traditions throughout the world, and they aren't strangers to internal conflict. The Syndicate's power and ambition is fueled by the aid of the traitorous **Hyperion** the Naive, the second child of *Gaia*, and a former third of the *Tri-Core*. With the Betrayal of Hyperion and the massacre known as *Bloody New Year*, the Syndicate began an all-out war against the Commonwealth. The Elder Council claims they have Hyperion under *their* control, but does anyone really believe that?
