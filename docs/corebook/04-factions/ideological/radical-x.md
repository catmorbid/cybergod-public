## The Radical X

The Radical Human Expression Front started out as a group of artists and free thinkers that always were highly critical of the Commonwealth. They held rallies, protests and occasionally vandalized public property. Not too soon after the *Bloody New Year* they radicalized and started organizing into independent *cells* of radical opposition against the Commonwealth and Tri-Core. They have since evolved into full-blown terrorists that seek to take down the Commonwealth by any means necessary, including mass murder, suicide bombings, sabotage, assassination. The Radical X is organized into terrorist cells, and their true leadership is unknown, but some conspiracies claim they're working for someone high up in the Commonwealth. The Radical X fights against the Commonwealth and anything that has to do with it. They occasionally work with the Syndicate and the Order of the Void, but some claim agents of Section 12 sometimes use them as tools in their own war.
