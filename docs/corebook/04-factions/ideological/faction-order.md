## The Order of the Void

The Order of the Void is a mysterious globally recognized spiritual cult that has roots in centuries old minor religious sects that were combined in to the Order of the Void just a few decades ago. The Order worships the **Sensible**, an allegedly extra-terrestrial intelligence that offers their followers terrifying gifts that alter their bodies forming them into supernatural enhanced monstrosities they use to terrorize their opponents and wreak havoc among the population. On the other hand they offer the weak and the destitute solace, comfort and communion, and claim to be a power for good. The Order has quickly gained massive popularity and its power and threat to Commonwealth is ever increasing.

The Order forbids the use of cybernetic enhancements and actively fights against human augmentation. Instead their high-ranking members, collectively referred to as **The Blessed**, receive the *Blessings of the Sensible*, a powerful microbic infusion that has the capability of transforming the recipients body to a living, biological weapon.

> The Order of the Void cannot resurrect in the same way other factions can. In fact they do not even have a Black Box, nor a Cybernetic Brain. But they do have other means. The Biomorphs naturally store an imprint of the individual's psyche and through gathering of the remnants of the deceased character, they can be *regrown* into a new body at one of the Order's secret facilities. This is not nearly as effective as being simply uploaded to a remote server and downloaded back into a new frame again, and takes quite a bit longer, so don't expect to be back on your feet the next session. On the other hand, whenever you are *reborn* as a *Blessed*, you gain an Upgrade Point and get to keep whatever progression you gained from your previous trials.
