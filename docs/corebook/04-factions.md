# 0x04 >> Factions
Beyond the utopian facade of the Mega Cities is a world in turmoil: War Zones mark areas of active conflict between the ARC and the Syndicate, and within the liberated Free Ports, the Order of the Void seeks influence and control in street-level confrontations, offering veiled aid for the common people. Where the war is not openly fought, it is fought from shadows and through political intrigue. Everyone looks to sway public opinion in their favor, to weaken the opposition by any means.

You pick a side, a Faction in this conflict, which determines who do you work for: Who hands out the orders and bankrolls your existence. Each Faction has an agenda, which often conflicts with one more more factions, so they do not always, if ever, work well together.

Faction also determines what kind gear and frames you can start with and which augments you can install on them. Choose a **Frame** from one of the given options to determine your **Attributes** and **Augments**. Each Augment starts at Level 1.

> [!info] Players are a Team
> Player characters start out working together. They are an established team with history and some degree of mutual trust. It's often easiest if everyone starts out in the same Faction. You can choose to mix it up, but you need to figure out together why they are a team, especially if there's conflicting agendas involved.
