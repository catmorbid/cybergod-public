# 0x09 >> Gear

The Commonwealth is a resource-based economy where resources are distributed by need. There's a complicated Credit system in place which is linked to an individual's DNA-based biosignature that is used to track Credit usage, but most of the time individuals do not need to worry about spending credits and can simply take what they require.

That is not the case for anyone outside of the confines of Commonwealth, and in the streets and black markets there's a lively barter economy and a number of Cryptographic currencies in circulation.

Player characters can freely choose their equipment based on their equipment's Grade. In addition the players can utilize **Team Assets** which are shared among the team. Personal Gear consists mostly of weapons, armor and perhaps some tools or Gadgets.

## Grade
Availability is measured with a **Grade**:
- **Basic** — Basic commodities available to every citizen of Commonwealth. Purchase of large quantities may be flagged and require explanation and price could be adjusted accordingly if signs of abuse are noted.
- **Common** — Available to all citizens of Commonwealth with reasonable cause. Includes many harmful substances and weapons classified for self defense.
- **Uncommon** — Not available to citizens without proper clearance and a license. E.g. professional tools and most firearms. Possession without clearance may result in minor sanctions.
- **Advanced** — Restricted availability. Requires high level clearance. Possession without clearance comes with heavy sanctions.
- **Rare** — Very restricted availability. Requires extremely high level clearance. Possession without clearance is a major violation and may result in extreme sanctions.
- **Exotic** — Technology that is not available even with highest connections. Restricted to a specific faction or organization, includes prototype or highly restricted technology.

## Bulk

Bulk determines general bulkiness of items, incorporating both mass and size. A character's **Max Bulk** rating is equal to the their Body Die size, i.e. for D6 Body Max Bulk is 6 and for D12 Body it is 12. This limit determines how much stuff you can carry around without being penalized. The stuff includes both Armor and Weapons, plus any extra equipment carried and Reloads.



## Weapons

### Stats

#### Damage Class
How effective the weapon is. Determines base Damage Class on a Hit.

#### Range

Noted as `Optimal Range - Effective Range`. Or just Optimal Range if only one range is noted.

**Optimal Range** where weapon is best utilized. Take -1D penalty for each range increment more or less than indicated range.

**Effective Range** is the maximum suggested range for the weapon. Damage Class is reduced by 1 for each range increment further than Effective Range.

#### Recoil

How much the weapon kicks when fired. You need to match recoil with high enough **Body** attribute to mitigate recoil, otherwise you take a -1D penalty to attack for every step of Recoil missing. Having 2+ steps higher recoil also means you take Bruise or greater wound each time you use the weapon.
- Low: Body D6 to mitigate recoil
- Moderate: Body D8 to mitigate recoil
- High: Body D10 to mitigate recoil
- Extreme: Body D12 to mitigate recoil

Recoil can be reduced by one degree by having a support device for the weapon, such as a bipod. The support device typically adds **2 Bulk**. Properly mounted weapons always mitigate the recoil entirely.
#### Area
Area is used for explosives and such to determine how large area is affected when the weapon is used. Area of effect weapons can catch multiple enemies under the weapon's effect. Every target near the primary target will take damage, but they can attempt a **Reflex Save** to quickly take cover with difficulty depending on the Area property. If the save is successful, they take only half damage. The primary target of the attack will however always take full damage.


| Area     | Description                                                                                                  | Save Dif. |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Small    | Radius is few meters at most and can impact up to three targets in close vicinity.                           | 2         |
| Moderate | Easily a dozen meters or more. Usually up to 6 targets.                                                      | 4         |
| Large    | Large areas covering several dozen meters from point of impact. Affects easily up to 20 targets in vicinity. | 6         |
| Huge     | Covers a massive area of hundred meters or more. Affects every target in the area, as many as needed.        | 8         |

>[!example]
>Morales' team of insurgents is ambushed by an ARC-backed regulator force. They are under heavy fire and take cover behind nearby concrete pillars, but the ARC Bulwark giving fire support has an automatic grenade launcher and lands a burst of grenades in their general direction.

### Tags

Tags are used for additional rules regarding weapons.

### Reloads

Each Reload has a Bulk of 0.25, so you can carry 4 Reloads for 1 Bulk. Reloads are specific to weapons you carry, but you can abstract your personal reloads. When looting ammo from dead enemies, you might not find the correct ammo. Also when an ally is out of ammo, they need to have a matching weapon or your reloads won't be of use to them.

### Ammo Save

When required, make an Ammo Save. Roll a D6, and on 6, you're out of ammo and need to reload. Mark down every Ammo Save you passed, and future Ammo Saves are rolled with an additional die. On 6th consecutive ammo save, you are forced to reload. Clear the marks after reload.

> [!info] Post-combat Ammo Checks
> As a rule of thumb, if you used a weapon in combat, make a single Ammo Save for it after the combat is over. You can disregard this if you just reloaded.

### Sidearms

`Range Combat x Reflex`
Sidearms are small **(Bulk 1)** and easily concealed under clothing. They are not suitable for main weapons in serious combat duty, but serve as easily concealable backup weapons. Sidearms can be used effectively one-handed, but a two-handed grip is more common, reducing their effective [[#Recoil]] by one degree.

### Assault Weapons

`Ranged Combat x Reflex`
Assault Weapons are usually Medium sized weapons **(Bulk 2)** that require a *two-handed grip* for effective use. They are designed for moderate to long-ranged encounters. You can wield an assault Weapon in one hand, but this will increase [[#Recoil]] by one step.

### Heavy Weapons

`Ranged Combat x Body` Machineguns
`Ranged Combat x Reflex` Launchers and Cannons

Heavy weapons fit the support role. They are big and clumsy **(Bulk 4)** and most of them are designed to be set up on a fixed position before firing, but can be used while detached. Heavy Weapons have reduced (-1) recoil when using from a fixed position. You need to spend an action to set up a heavy weapon properly.

### Precision Weapons

`Ranged Combat x Mind`

Precision weapons are ideal for extreme range support and assassinations. They are somewhat big and clumsy **(Bulk 3)** and tend to have low rate of fire, but can be used at extreme range. Precision Weapons are more effective when when deployed as a dedicated two-person team where one operates the weapon while the other acts as a spotter. A remote-operated drone can also be used as extra pair of eyes for an effective lone sniper. Precision Weapons require good focus to utilize effectively.

### Explosives

**Throwing**: `Ranged Combat x Body`, Distance thrown requires spending Effect cost for throwing distance. If you fail to meet desired range effect cost, the throw will fall short.

| Range Thrown | Effect Cost |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Close        | 0           |
| Short        | 1           |

### Melee Weapons

`Close Combat x Body or Reflex`

Melee weapon can be anything from a blunt object to a master-crafted nano-edge katana blade. While ranged weapons are usually the preferred way to fight, a melee weapon can have the edge in close quarters. They are also common among lowlife street thugs, due to restrictions place in the ownership of personal firearms.

**Size** of a Melee weapon determines how heavy and bulky the weapon is. If you have less Body than the indicated minimum, you get -1D when handling the weapon for each step less. A melee weapon can be wielded two-handed to reduce the Body requirement by one degree.

### Custom Spec Weapons
Custom Spec weapons allow you to modify standard weapons with attachments or high quality components.

The rules of obtaining Custom Spec weapons are relatively simple: For each modification you increase the Rarity of the weapon by one, and can now apply one of the following modifications:
- Remove a negative Tag (e.g. Inaccurate)
- Add any custom-spec compliant Tag (e.g. Soft Piercing)
- Upgrade a basic tag to a more advanced variant (e.g. Soft Piercing -> Hard Piercing)

Custom Spec weapons are difficult to replace and you cannot expect your Faction to simply have them lying around, so losing your weapon or dying horribly explosive death means you will also lose your custom spec weapon. In addition your weapon might use unique ammunition and it might be difficult for you to find extra reloads on the field.

GM can veto any custom spec weapons if they do not make any sense, so try to make up a good explanation on how the modifications be made possible.
## Personal Armor

### Ballistic Weave
Ballistic Weave can be manufactured into common clothing. It protects the user from small arms and knives, but not much more.
### Nano Weave
Nano Weave uses advanced nanotech materials to create a lightweight protective mesh in clothing and can be fabricated into almost anything. Nano Weave is stain-proof and self-repairing. Restore all Soft Mitigation and 1 point of Hard mitigation in Moderate duration when not subjected to more damage.
### Ballistic Plates
A thin layer of poly-ceramic armor that can be inserted to clothing and combat vests. It won't withstand sustained fire, but may be a lifesaver when nothing better is available.
### Security Armor
A lightweight suit of body armor with layers of ballistic weave and poly-ceramic plating. The body armor is often complemented with arm and leg guards and a lightweight helmet with an info-visor covering the eyes. Standard issue for regulator units and corporate security throughout the world.
### Combat Armor
Combat armor is a bulky suit of polymer-ceramic armor intended for military operations. Standard issue comes with a body armor and separate pieces for arms and legs, as well as a heavy-duty helmet with full face protection and a Smart visor.
### Hard Shell
A seamless full-body suit built for heavy encounters. Toughest available in un-powered suits. It adds a lot of bulk, but offers excellent protective capabilities and can withstand a few shots from even heaviest weapons.
### Powered Armor
Powered armor are wearable exosuits designed for human soldiers to improve the wearer's strength, stamina and coordination with assisted robotic limbs. The technology was refined in the the pre-collapse era and has seen only minor improvements since then. The technology is expensive and has some practical issues making it effectively obsolete compared to cybernetic frames.

> [!info]
> Always use the powered armor's attributes over the Frame's normal attribute, even if the armor has worse attributes.

## Equipment
You can also carry various tools and other useful equipment. Your faction can probably provide you with facilities for anything you need, but sometimes it's handy to have some things with you on the field.
