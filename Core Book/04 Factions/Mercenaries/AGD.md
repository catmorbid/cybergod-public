## Atlas Global Defense (AGD)
Atlas Global Defense is a private military contractor aligned with the Commonwealth. They manage a large military-industrial complex and are involved in many military R&D projects. In addition, AGD provides a significant force of security and military personnel for a large number of sanctioned clients, most of which are private corporations or individuals. Military contracting is extremely regulated and scrutinized and with perseverance, strict code of conduct and unapologetic ruthlessness, AGD has managed to gain and hold a significant position in the field.

AGD mercenaries take any kind of contracts and unlike other factions, they are in it just for the money. They have been involved in a large number of operations for decades and while their reputation is outstanding, it is not completely impeccable, and there have been reports of unprofessional behavior, abuse of power and involvement in illegal operations. AGD attempts to maintain a public image that is clean, reliable and trustworthy, so it will take whatever means necessary to maintain this image.

### Technology
AGD has access to cybernetic augments, but Commonwealth regulations only allow **Level 2** augments to private operators. In addition, they are cleared for **Advanced grade** equipment, and may not officially obtain higher grade equipment. The AGD has found to be circumventing these regulations at times through backchannel access, or even resorting to black market and hacked or reverse-engineered schematics.
