## The Cyberweavers

The weavers are a secret society of mercenaries that specialize in cyber warfare that allegedly helped Syndicate free **Hyperion** from the *Tri-Core* and become a free agent. They are free agents themselves and offer their services to anyone willing to pay the price. They operate beyond the confines of society, forming underground communities of individuals that life off the grid. They are independent and resourceful, and at the same time highly appreciated and vilely hated, since they do work for any side willing to pay. The Cyberweavers take great interest in cybernetic technology and like to augment themselves extensively, with little regard to retaining their humanity.
