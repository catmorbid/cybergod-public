## Running a Story
A story should be built around the characters who take a central role in the story. What's the team like and who do they work for would likely determine the general mood of the story.

### Progression

As you play stories the characters will progress in their abilities. This progression is reflected by **Progression Points**, which are earned after each session. Mark progression points in the Character Sheet, and once you've gathered enough, you can spend some or all of them to improve your character.

Each game session should end with a short retrospective on how the session went. Have a free discussion, gather feedback and finally award Progression. Progression is freeform, but here are some suggestions
- **Session Participation**: Everyone  gets 1 Progression for participating the session
- **Danger**: If you were in serious danger, you get another point.
- **Intrigue**: Participating in high stakes intrigue is worth some progression
- **Humanity**: Character expressed their human side, taking into account their Engrams.

Some things that should not be awarded:
- Random Violence
- Deliberately hindering or complicating team efforts, unless there is a solid cause.
- Taking all the spotlight. Everyone should have a turn to play.


| Progression Points | Rewards         |
|:------------------ |:------------------- |
| 2                  | Skill Level 1       | 
| 4                  | Skill Level 1->2 |
| 5                  | Erase Corruption    |
| 6                  | Skill Level 2->3 |
| 8                  | Skill Level 3->4 |
| 10                 | Aptitude Point      |

### Merits
Merits are used to measure how well the group did in their mission. Each Mission Objective is worth a certain amount of Merits.
- **Primary Objectives**: Critical to mission completion. 3 Merits on success, -2 merits on failure.
- **Secondary Objectives**: Important objectives, but maybe not critical to mission success. 2 Merits on success, -1 merits on failure.
- **Optional Objectives**: Bonus objectives that are completely optional. 1 Merits each, no penalty for failure.

Merits are marked on Merit tracker, which works much like Progression tracker. Once the you have enough points accumulated, you can exchange them for the corresponding reward.

| Merit Points | Rewards        |
|:------------ |:-------------- |
| 2            | Team Assets +1 |
| 4            | Influence +1   |
| 10           | Upgrade Point  |

#### Team Assets
Team Assets represent influence in the players' faction(s) and how much resources is the the faction willing to provide to the team. Team Assets are essentially a pool of points available to the team to utilize during tough situations. Everyone shares the team assets and everyone can utilize them, and it's up to the team to resolve usage of their shared assets. If someone wants to be the boss of the assets, everyone else needs to agree and so on. You don't need to know what assets your team exactly has, but you can instead spend a point whenever the situation calls for it.

Team starts with a number of Team Assets equal to `Number of Players + 1`. You can then consult the table below as to what kind of things the assets can be used at.

Certain assets require some degree of influence as well, represented by Influence Points.

| Team Asset                 | Description                                                                                                                                       | AP  | IP  |

#### Influence
Influence is social currency within a Faction. You gain Influence primarily by completing jobs for a Faction. You can purchase Influence with Merits.

Influence can spent to call in favors, obtain information and may be required for certain team assets. You can suggest uses freely, but GM has to approve all influence expenditure.

### Story seeds
Listed below are some seeds or ideas for a story. You will find recommended factions #tagged to help pick the the ones suitable for your players. Mercenary factions generally fit in every scenario as they work for the highest bidder.

#### Raid
#ARC #Section12 or #Syndicate #RadicalX #OrderOfTheVoid
The team takes part in a huge raid to take down a large criminal element. The raid is led by an elite ARC strike team, and supported by ordinary Regulators and drones. Section 12 operators were involved in organizing the raid, so they might be present to see it through.

The most probable enemy enemy would be the Syndicate, Order of the Void or Radical X. You can also create your own criminal faction.

The raid was carefully planned for months, and now it's time to execute, but as they proceed something goes wrong...
1. The other side got tipped off. The traitor must be found!
2. Another faction intervenes, why?
3. Surprise! A bigshot is visiting the site. Attackers should prioritize their capture while defenders should protect them at all costs.
4. An elite enemy unit is present that makes the task extremely difficult
5. The defenders are retreating but the site is rigged to blow up! Attackers have limited time to find and disarm all the explosives.

For a longer story you can start way before the raid takes place and take part in planning the raid.

#### Terrorist attack
#ARC #Section12 or #RadicalX #OrderOfTheVoid 

A faction is planning public act of terror to destabilize the Commonwealth.

Commonwealth objectives
- Avoid collateral damage
- Neutralize the terrorist threat
- Protect critical objectives

Terrorist objectives
- Take hostages and wreak havoc
- Cause as much damage as possible
- Denial of Access
- Obtain critical objectives.

#### Augmented Serial killer
#ARC #Section12
A serial killer is on the loose. This is normally CRA Regulator business, but you have reason to believe the killer is seriously augmented. Who do they work for, and what is their agenda? #Section12 may have interest in the case if targets are high-value VIP's or if they have a reason to believe the Order of the Void is involved, or some other strange things are happening.

Objectives
- Catch the killer
- Prevent further killings
- Find out who bankrolled their augments

#### Evo Sim Ascendance
#Cyberweavers #Section12 #Syndicate 
An Evo-Sim, or an artificial intelligence created with evolutionary methods to mimic real memories and human growth, has been detected accessing Cyberweb freely without limitations. Evo Sims are regulated and must be contained and never have free reign in the Cyberweb. This can lead to full AI Ascendance, i.e. the spontaneous creation of a Super Intelligence. Evo Sims are designed to have human emotions making them unstable platforms for super intelligence, and without oversight such entities can be dangerous.

Objectives
- Track down the entity and contain their access to Cyberweb
- Find out who is responsible for releasing the Evo Sim and bring them in.

Syndicate or Cyberweavers may have different ideas for the Entity, but everyone recognizes that letting it have free reign in Cyberweb is dangerous and bad for everyone.

Maybe you can find a cool angle for another faction? Go for it.

#### Psionic Incident
#Section12
A Spontaneous psionic incident has been detected. Section 12 is dispatched to find out the cause of the incident and contain it. Public safety is important, but the subject must not be harmed.

Objectives
- Track down and contain the subject
- Resolve timeline events for the incident
- Do not harm the subject

Other factions may have interest in the incident as well, but it is significantly more difficult for them to locate psionic incidents.

#### Bio Weapon Threat
#ARC #Section12 #RadicalX #Syndicate 

An unknown bioweapon is loose on a Megacity or a Freeport. What is the weapon and who is behind it?
1. Nano Plague that targets specific DNA markers
2. Zombie Virus
3. Bio-engineered monstrosity
4. Genetically modified animals
5. Contaminated food products that cause mass hallucinations
6. An advanced designer drug that is highly addictive and highly lethal

## Enemies and NPC's
During stories characters will likely encounter other characters, many of whom will oppose them in one way or another. You can use the following examples, or create your own.

### NPC stats
You can always create an enemy or NPC using the normal character creation rules, but it is fine to simplify the rules a bit. Minor characters presented in this section use the following set of simplified stats.

| Tier   | BOD | REF | MND | CYB | Expertise        | Pools | Mitigation | Wounds |
| :----- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--------------- | :---- | :--------- | ------ |
| Common | D6  | D6  | D6  | D6  | Combat, Physical | 4/2   | 2/0/0      | 2      |

**Tier** indicates a rough level of opposition. Higher tier characters can take more wounds and should have better equipment. The tiers are **Common**, **Tough** and **Elite**.

**Attributes** indicate the attribute die used for those characters.

**Expertise** is an array of aptitudes where the character is most experienced at, hence using their Primary pool.

**Pools** are listed as primary / secondary and indicate dice pools to be used when making tests. Primary pool is used when task falls within their Expertise, otherwise use the secondary Pool. Optionally you can decide they are inept at something and roll half secondary pool.

**Mitigation** indicates how many mitigation points they should have available. The values are noted in order of Soft/Hard/Ultra mitigation.

**Wounds** indicates how many slots they have for non-stopping wounds. Otherwise mark 1 wound for minor wound, 2 for major wound and 4 for lethal wound. For common tier characters Major Wound is a stopping wounds, but higher tier enemies may be able to withstand more punishment.

Use the following table to determine Wounds based on Body attribute and the NPC's significance.

| Body | Common | Tough | Elite |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| D6   | 2      | 4     | 6     |
| D8   | 3      | 6     | 9     |
| D10  | 4      | 8     | 12    |
| D12  | 5      | 10    | 15    |
**Energy** simply shows how many Energy Points they have for using active Augments. The rules are the same as for Player characters, so the Level of augment indicates the cost in energy.

**Augments** are displayed as separate block if the character has any.

**Attacks** are listed in separate block and shows a typical attacks and weapons used.

### Baselines
Baseline encounters are mostly human or humans with some augmented attributes, but usually no active augments.

#### Security Forces
`Common`

#### R-LER
`Tough`

Nicknamed "Rollers", the R-LER are heavily armored six-wheeled urban pacification drones that consist of the wheel system chassis and an armored turret section with various sensors placed in several redundant locations. The R-LER typically stands 150cm from the ground and is 125cm wide, weighing at 150kg without weapons load, most of which is the weight of the heavy armor plating. Its adaptive wheel system can be adjusted in any direction enabling it to handle almost any terrain and even climb stairs and it can reach High Velocity on roads. Its turret placement can also adjust in height between 130cm and 180cm from the ground to reach optimal tactical position.

The R-LER were once the backbone of urban pacification, but have since reached infamy after the Bloody New Year, which saw thousands of them participate in the massacre. The "Rollers" are still a solid part of the Regulator arsenal as support units for Regulator squads in high-risk encounters. Other factions utilize them occasionally as well.

| BOD | REF | MND | CYB | Expertise        | Pools | Mitigation | Wounds |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:---------------- |:----- |:---------- | ------ |

Sentinels do not typically carry any concealed weaponry, instead they use their Psionics in combat, but will ultimately attempt to flee the scene instead of dragging out combat for too long, knowing that their psionics will not last for long encounters.
#### Protector
`Tough`
Protectors are heavily armed masked fighters designated to protecting high value VIP's. Their standard gear includes a pitch black Combat Armor without any recognizable insigia, or a similarly styled Hard Shell suit, with an array of powerful energy weapons. While for other Section 12 operatives discretion is key, Protectors disregard this entirely, and apparently that's the crux of it.

Berserkers are aggressive close combat fighters augmented to inflict maximum damage in close quarters. Their regeneration augment makes them difficult to deal with and once up-close they strike hard and fast. Many Berserkers opt for integrated weapon systems.

Martyrs have the Honor of carrying The Crucible, Radical X's infamous weapon of mass destruction. They are all about terror and dread. Tactics-wise Martyrs do not engage in frontlines, since no one wants them to die ahead of time, so they tend to be in the support role but can adequately utilize all types of weapons.
