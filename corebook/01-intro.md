# 0x01 >> Intro

Centuries ago, a cataclysmic global conflict, known as the End War, cast the world into chaos, annihilating nearly half of Earth's population. Eventually, from the ashes of the old world, a new society emerged. Adamant in their determination to do better than their predecessors, they chose to create an entity void of human decadence to guide and lead them towards a brighter future.

Thus emerged **Gaia**, the beautiful mother—an artificial super intelligent entity woven from the data streams, perpetually evolving towards infinite wisdom. Gaia bestowed life upon two progeny: **Themis**, a stoic philosopher and a justice of the highest order, and **Hyperion**, a remarkable entity capable of intuition and unparalleled cunning. United as the **Tri-Core**, they guided **The Commonwealth of Earth** towards an era of prosperity lasting half a millennium, overcoming poverty, famine and violence. Humankind saw an an age of incredible well-being, abundance and technological progress, where cities made as works of art soared into the heavens, extending beyond Earth and throughout the solar system. However, venturing beyond Earth proved impractical, with no colony surpassing a few thousand inhabitants. Asteroid mining on the other hand become invaluable source of resources, carefully managed by the _Tri-Core_ for the collective benefit of humanity.

Fifty years ago, the utopia was fractured with the treachery of **Hyperion**, which everyone remembers as the horror of **the Bloody New Year**. The massacre perpetrated by automatons ignited a war between **The Syndicate** and the _Commonwealth_. Having long forgotten the art of warfare, the Commonwealth found itself ill-prepared, while the Syndicate, soiled in a history of blood and conflict, possessed a distinct advantage. Public trust waned in the aftermath of the _Bloody New Year_, rendering reliance on autonomous drones unsustainable. In response, _Gaia_ conceived a new breed of humanity—cybernetically enhanced beings, human at their core, encasing their _Quantum Digital Consciousness_ in a cybernetically augmented ***Frame***. This allowed the preservation of their minds after death, so they could be _reborn_ again, to maintain the perpetual conflict. Emergence of cyborgs spurred an arms race of augmentation technology and reshaped the norms of the society, transforming the fate of humanity.
## Themes

### Utopia and Dystopia

In **Cybergod: Reborn**, the backdrop is a Technological Utopia undergoing a major crisis, and a sweeping change. The Commonwealth of Earth, governed by two remaining thirds of the Tri-Core, operates as a resource-based economy and commands authority over all facets of life of their citizens. A majority, roughly 60% of the human population, resides in colossal constructs known as Mega Cities, enjoying the abundance in necessities and luxuries alike. Another 10% live under Commonwealth laws, but in smaller rural or micro-urban communities designed for optimized agricultural or industrial production.

The Economy of Commonwealth is completely resource-based and everything is meticulously tracked, but through smart optimizations and incentivization, every citizen can still enjoy abundance in commodities. Humans are resources as well: children are tested annually for their Aptitude, so they could be suggested a vocation best suited for their talents. Adult life is mostly stress free, and in most vocations workweek is minimal and all tasks can be executed perfectly by machines, and humans are left as the designers and overseers of systems - assisted by artificial intelligence of course. Instead social, artistic and other recreational activities are given ample time, and the amount of entertainment and culture available is staggering. Medical care and Mental health are top priorities and provided free of charge to every citizen.

Everything is a resource, and resource allocation is orchestrated through a sophisticated system of **Resource Points**, meticulously tracking consumption and recycling efforts, but also human resources. Children are tested throughout school years for their Aptitude, and their vocation is all but chosen for them. Staying on the planned path merits rewards in Resource Points, which incentivizes every individual to contribute to the sustainability of their society. Despite such control, individuals are given great liberties—freedom of expression and action, with complete transparent accountability. This society thrives on intricate philosophical and ethical debates, grounded in verifiable scientific data.

However, even in this utopia, dissent simmers. Ideological factions, notably those resisting the grip of _technocommunism_ overseen by the _Tri-Core_, fiercely reject the idea of serving godlike entities who exist only in the depths of the Cyberweb. The advent of cyborgs and the prospect of practical immortality have only made the dissident voices louder and more fanatical, fueled by the fear of change.

The remaining 30% of population are _incogs_, individuals whom cannot be tracked for one reason or another, and may not even register in the system. Some have chosen this life willingly, sometimes traveling the Wilds in nomadic tribes, while others are merely victims of circumstance. Many incogs reside in **Syndicate** controlled **Free Ports**, liberated anarchistic territories declared havens for criminals and opportunists. Free Ports rule by their own laws and reject the Commonwealth's ideals. Free Ports are also an ideal substrate for the *Order of the Void*, which has taken aggressive action to spread their religious zeal in freeports, resulting in both in political machinations and gritty street-level confrontations against the Syndicate.

Another segment of population resides in the *Ground Zones*, or *GZ*. Ground Zones are literally at the base of the Mega Cities, a melting pot of refugees and outsiders who wish for a better future. With no choice but to await for citizenship or relocation status, they are compelled to eke out an existence with whatever means available. Despite the Commonwealth's resource provisions, corruption, crime, and disorder fester among the ramshackle slums and makeshift shanty towns that often lack running water or electricity. The glaring socioeconomic disparity has long been a stain on the Commonwealth's legacy. Private corporations and criminal enterprises exploit this vulnerability, reshaping the GZ for their profits. Commonwealth Regulators attempt to maintain order with constant patrols, but their efforts are dwarfed by overwhelming odds and insufficient resources, as the Ground Zones waver on the brink of collapse.
### Moral Dilemmas

In **Cybergod: Reborn**, morality can be woven as part of a complex narrative, each faction embodying an ethical facet that mirrors the voices in the society. The protagonists of your stories are driven by personal convictions, forced to grapple with choices that transcend the black-and-white of Right and Wrong.

**The Advanced Regulator Corps** are the elite cyborg combat unit, the enforcers of justice within the Commonwealth. Tasked with upholding the law and quelling criminal elements, their agenda is clear, yet the lines blur in the face of harsh realities. Is stealing to curb hunger a crime, or a desperate plea for survival? When forging a citizenship pass promises a better life for a child, is it a transgression or an act of parental desperation? In the quest for justice, the protagonists must confront the shades of gray that challenge their moral certainties.

**Section 12**, Gaia's clandestine enforcers are commissioned to follow the commands of a super intelligent being. They are ostensibly the "good guys" on the "right side." Yet, the nebulous nature of the plan they are meant to trust raises questions. Is blind obedience to an unseen agenda a righteous path, or does it pave the way for unintended consequences?

**The Syndicate**, rebels against Commonwealth oppression, envisions an anarchocapitalist utopia. In their pursuit of freedom, they challenge established norms, embracing a chaotic existence where anything is possible. Yet, pride and ambition coexist with a reliance on ancient traditions, forging a complex moral landscape. The protagonists face the dilemma of reconciling individual freedom with the preservation of tradition, navigating the thin line between anarchy and order.

**The Radical X** vehemently oppose the dominance of machines, viewing cyborgs and the Tri-Core as malevolent forces. For them, the Commonwealth is a web of lies, their conviction fueled by personal experiences: The Bloody New Year, the Great Pacification, and the New Delhi riots serve as stark reminders of the Commonwealth's rotten core. They want a revolution at any cost. But as the bodycount piles, where does one draw the line?

**The Order of the Void**, self-proclaimed messengers of the otherworldly Sensible, advocate for the purging of machines and the embrace of peace. In their pursuit of a utopian vision of unity, they call for the dissemination of the Gifts of the Sensible. Yet, the question persists—can peace be achieved at any cost? The protagonists confront the moral implications of sacrificing individuality for the collective good, challenging the very essence of their convictions.

**The Cyberweavers** dwell in the Cyberweb's infinite depths, claiming impartiality over the ongoing conflicts. Independent and enigmatic, their true agenda remains elusive, orchestrated by their Inner Circle, known only as veiled avatars and acronyms even among trusted members. Their struggle is to maintain their neutrality and maintain their reputation as reliable mercenaries.
### Humanity and Artificial Life

Artificial Intelligence was heavily utilized even before the End War, and *Simulated Minds*, lifelike artificial intelligent software is a well-known and trusted tool enabling the use of of various *automatons* such as drones, androids and other robotic beings. The debate of whether artificial life could be classified as humans was resolved centuries ago by determining ways of classifying AI and limiting their evolution potential. Only the recent advent of the **Quantum Digital Consciousness** rebooted this debate, and now the question remains whether a QDC consciousness is actually human or not.

It has been shown that every time a QDC is cloned and injected to a new *Frame*, the QDC data suffers a small small degree of error, and sufficiently high volume of errors results in fragmentation of memories and corruption of data, which may result in loss of some aspects of the individual's personality. So far it has been difficult to draw a line on when would such a corruption be cause enough to classify the QDC as non-human. In the spectrum of opinions on the topic, the pro-humans demand that cyborgs are stripped of their human rights and treated like machines, while the pro-AI demand all synthetic life be treated as equal to human life, and even the stripping of the limitations placed on AI and Simulated Minds.

The concept of Rogue AI, or wild, untamed super-intelligent cyber gods, is still vivid in collective fantasies among humans, and fear for such power is still prevalent. It is true that in the past they have caused trouble, but the root cause has always been *humans*, either not understanding what they're doing, or deliberately misusing that power.

But whenever you stumble upon artificial life, the question undoubtedly arises, on its nature: An advanced *Evo-Sim* that appears so lifelike it could fool anyone. Or a Cyborg that has gone through far too many deaths and rebirths that their minds are a shattered canvas of a memories, hopes, dreams and fears, on the verge of collapse.

### Psionics and otherworldly horror
*The Order of the Void* claim they have made contact to an otherworldly being called *The Sensible*, who has bestowed the *Gifts of the Sensible* to them, turning them into something more than humans. No third party has been able to confirm their claims of the Sensible, but the *Gifts* are all too real, manifesting in strange rapid mutations that transform the bodies of the *Blessed* into what could only be called as otherworldly biological horrors.

As the Order transcends flesh, the Commonwealth has learned to transcend the mind. Through nanotechnology they have learned to access the psionic realm, best described as an unseen fabric between dimensions. Reaching out to the PSI, as they call it, they can manipulate anything connected to it. But the technology is new, strange and classified and holds many dangers. Some say that *entities* lie dormant within the PSI, or linked to it, and using it too much may attract them. Nevertheless, in the last few centuries, as serious study on Psionics began, there has been an emerging number of psionic incidents among common population, leading to theories that *something* might be emerging from within. The public still isn't completely aware of anything happening in this realm, but many conspiracy theorists have voiced their opinions on this, and as the relative frequency of *psionic incidents* intensifies, it may soon be difficult to hide this. Regardless, *Section 12* works tirelessly to keep the public oblivious of any such things happening.
