# 0x06 >> Frame

Frame is the physical body that character uses as host for their consciousness. Consciousness is digital and if you die you can be *reborn* in another frame. You pick one frame from those available to your [#Faction](#Faction), but you can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve it further. Factions provide the resources to you and are also responsible for your Upgrades.

## Attributes

Frame determines the character's attributes. Attributes are measured with a **Level** from 1 to 4 and each Level indicates a Die Size from D6 to D12. The average human has Level 1 attributes, i.e. a D6 in everything. If a frame is lacking any attribute, it cannot perform any related tasks.

> [!info]
> You can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve Attributes. Attributes cost **2 Upgrade Points**.

### Body

Body represents constitution, strength, fitness and athletic ability. Use Body to fight in close combat and perform tasks that require endurance, strength or athletic ability. Body affects many aspects of the character passively, although it might not be used in tests that much.

**Max Power** determines how much damage you can deal in close combat, indicating how many **Attack Power** effects you can take without harming yourself.

**Max Bulk** determines how much gear and armor you can carry without penalties. More info on [09-gear](09-gear.md Gear>)

**Wounds Slots** determine how much damage your Frame can take before going down. Higher level Body helps sustain more damage and still remain functional. See [07 Combat#Damage and Mitigation](07-combat.md#Damage%20and%20Mitigation Combat#Damage and Mitigation>) on how wound slots work.

| Body | Description | Max Power | Max Bulk | Wounds Slots                         |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| D6   | Average     | 1         | 6        | 2 Bruise, 2 Minor, 1 Major, 1 Lethal |
| D8   | Strong      | 2         | 8        | 3 Bruise, 3 Minor, 2 Major, 1 Lethal |
| D10  | Powerful    | 3         | 10       | 4 Bruise, 4 Minor, 2 Major, 2 Lethal |
| D12  | Superhuman  | 4         | 12       | 5 Bruise, 5 Minor, 3 Major, 2 Lethal |

### Reflex

Reflex determines hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Reflex is used to react to sudden situations, evade attacks and make ranged attacks.

Reflex affects **Initiative** which determines how fast you can act when making a Conflicting test in combat. Read more on this in [07-combat](07-combat.md Combat>). At D10 or higher Reflex you also become **Ambidextrous** and can handle actions with either hand effectively. Without ambidexterity, you take a -1D penalty to using your off-hand, when relevant.

| Reflex | Description | Initiative | Ambidextrous |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| D6     | Average     | 1          | No           |
| D8     | Quick       | 2          | No           |
| D10    | Graceful    | 3          | Yes          |
| D12    | Superhuman  | 4          | Yes          |

### Mind

Mind determines intellect, cunning, awareness and focus. Mind is is probably one of the most utilized attributes, but it does not have any passive effects.

| Mind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| D6   | Average     |
| D8   | Smart       |
| D10  | Genius      |
| D12  | Visionary  |

### Cyber

Cyber determines the character's ability to interface with computers, hack devices, engage in electronic and cyber warfare and defend against cyber intrusions.

Cyber determines how many **Apps** you can have installed. Apps are your weapons when using Combat Hacks. Read more about this on [08-cyber-warfare](08-cyber-warfare.md Cyber Warfare>).

| Cyber | Description     | Apps |
| ----- | --------------- | ---- |
| D6    | Common hardware | 2    |
| D8    | Hacker gear     | 4    |
| D10   | Military Grade  | 6    |
| D12   | Supercomputer   | 8    |

## Energy

Energy is used to fuel Augments. Each Attribute adds some Energy to the total based on its rating. You automatically recover 1 point of Energy after each scene, and additional 1D6 energy if you spend time recovering or consuming nutrients after.

| Attribute | Energy |
| :-------- | :----- |
| D8        | 1      |
| D10       | 2      |
| D12       | 4      |


## Augments

Your initial Augments are determined by your **Frame**. Choose a frame from the ones listed in your chosen Faction.

> [!info]
> You can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve Augments. Augment Level costs 1 Upgrade Point.

**Activating** Augments is an **Instant Action** and costs 1 Energy per Level. You can choose to activate lower level abilities to conserve energy. Some Augments are tagged as #Passive  and those do not require energy expenditure.

Many augments can be **Boosted** by spending additional energy. When some property can be boosted, it's marked with an arrow symbol ->, indicating the new boosted property.

**Safety**: High level augments or those tagged as #Unsafe will trigger a *Decay Save* whenever they're used. The die size depends on the augment level and whether the augment has the unsafe tag. Only augments that require activation trigger *Decay Saves*.

[Augment Safety table]

| Augment Level | Safe | Unsafe |
| ------------- | ---- | ------ |
| [1] Basic     | -    | D10    |
| [2] Advanced  | D12  | D8     |
| [3] Ultra     | D10  | D6     |

### Adrenaline Rush

#Biotech #Cybertech #Nanotech 

Enter a state of constant adrenaline frenzy improving overall combat capabilities. Once activated, the effect will be maintained for a **Moderate** duration, or until hostilities are ceased. Even then you might require some time to calm down.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                              |     |
| :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |

| 2     | Gain +2D in Combat actions. Ignore Major wound penalties. You can recognize friends and foes while frenzied.                                        |     |
| 3     | Gain +3D in Combat actions. When receiving Lethal Wounds you are no longer incapacitated and can take actions normally. You can end effect at will. |     |


### Aegis

#Cybertech 

Create energy field to protect yourself and those nearby. The shield lasts for a **Short** duration, but it can be maintained by spending another point of Energy.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Activate for 1 Energy. Generate a force field that affects anything within **Close** -> **Short** -> **Moderate** radius and adds **2 points** of **Ultra Mitigation**. Melee weapons bypass the shield. |
| 2     | Activate for 2 Energy. Shield adds **4 points** of **Ultra Mitigation**.                                                                                                                                 |
| 3     | Activate for 3 Energy. Shield adds **6 points** of **Ultra Mitigation**.                                                                                                                                 |

### Avatar

#Cybertech #Unsafe 

Avatar enables physical remote presence at very distant locations through holographic interface. You can use holoprojection drones and and a location's built-in projection systems by accessing the location through remote connection. Once connected you can project Holographic Avatars to interact on your behalf. The area can be extended by connecting to new Access Points. If you lose access to the location, or all of your holoprojector drones are destroyed, your Avatars will immediately perish.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:----- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Create a single Holographic Avatar within Moderate range for a Moderate duration for 1 Energy. Avatars are capable of normal physical interaction and they have Body D6 and Reflex D6. You can spend additional Energy to augment Avatar's Body or Reflex by one die step per Energy, up to D12. Avatars can pick up weapons and wear armor like any physical entity. |
| 2     | Long range. You can create multiple avatars, but each avatar costs separate energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3     | Extreme range. The total cost of each Avatar is halved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Biomorph Armor

#Biotech #Unsafe 

Biomorphs can be used to mutate the frame in a rapid rate to grow extra layers of protection from muscle, bones, tendons. The process is generally called creating a Biomorph armor, but it will also alter the character' physical traits in such significant way that calling it just "armor" seems like an understatement. Mutation is always permanent unless recalled. Mutating the frame and then recalling it takes just a short duration. The sight itself is so gruesome most characters witnessing it will take **Stress**. Biomorph Armor can be reactivated to regenerated spent mitigation points.


| Level | Effect                  |
|:----- |:----------------------- |
| 1     | Gain 5 Soft Mitigation. |
| 2     | Gain 5 Hard Mitigation. |
| 3     | Gain 5 Ultra Mitigation |

### Biomorph Healing

#Biotech #Unsafe 

You can use Biomorphs from close proximity to another target, or heal yourself to by spending an Action. Total **Healing Power** is `2x Energy Spent`, but each level requires a minimum energy to be spent to activate. You can spend additional energy to improve the effect, but the maximum wound level is limited by the ability.

Healing Power is a pool of points you can use to heal wounds. A wound requires Healing Power equal to their Damage Class equivalence.

>[!example]
>a Major Wound occurs at Damage Class 3, so you need 3 Healing Power to heal a Major Wound.

| Level | Effect              |
|:----- |:------------------- |
| 1     | Heal Minor Wounds.  |
| 2     | Heal Major Wounds.  |
| 3     | Heal Lethal Wounds. |

### Biomorph Invasion

#Biotech #Unsafe 

Invade a target with parasitic Biomorphs that latch onto the target's biological components. Gain access to their motor functions and even cognitive state. Synthetic frames cannot be invaded, but even Cybernetic frames are susceptible to invasion. Target must be within close range and unable or unwilling to resist physically. It is practical to first physically incapacitate the target before attempting invasion.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Zombification**: Render the target into a mindless husk that can follow simple orders. Long Duration. Resist with a Body Save vs. Mind -> +1 -> +2                                       |
| 2     | **Mind Spy**: Gain telepathic link between target and yourself. You can share thoughts to them and pry on their thoughts. Long Duration. Resist with Mind Save vs Mind -> +1 -> +2         |
| 3     | **Indoctrinate**: Alter the subject's cognitive state. They perceive you as an ally and will fight for you to the death. Long Duration. Resist with Body or Mind Save vs. Mind -> +1 -> +2 |

### Biomorph Weapons

#Biotech #Unsafe 

You can use Biomorphs to transform your flesh into deadly weapons, increasing your mass and density, forming new growth and matter. The process is almost instantaneous and by the time you see the transformation, it's likely too late. 

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                             |
|:----- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | **Bone Talon**: Grow a long, pointy talon in one of your arms. DC 3 Close Range, Armor Piercing.                                                                   |
| 1     | **Razor Blades**: Transform your fingers into sharp razor blades made of unnaturally dense bone. DC 3, Close Range, Double Hits.                                   |
| 2     | **Meat Club**: Undergo incredible growth on one of your limbs, creating a huge awkward club made of hardened flesh and bone. DC 5, Close Range, Inaccurate         |
| 2     | **Bone Whip**: Grow a long, fleshy whip with razor-like bone claws protruding out. Slow attack that is easy to avoid. DC 4 Short Range, Inaccurate.                |
| 3     | **Flesh Crusher**: Transform half of your body and a ton of additional mass into a massive deformed bludgeoning device. DC 8 Short Range, Inaccurate, Area (small) |
| 3     | **Tentacle Madness**: A mass of fleshy tentacles explode from your body ripping into any living things nearby. DC 5 Moderate Range, attack up to 10 targets.       |

### Camouflage

#Biotech #Cybertech #Nanotech 

A stealth augment that can blend the character with their surroundings. Advanced tiers also help mitigate noise from movement and provide additional masking options. Unless an observers has a way to see through the camouflage, they cannot see the cyborg and have a -4D penalty to any actions against them, if even allowed. Camouflage is maintained even after the cyborg attacks a target, but taking any wounds will interfere with the camouflage.

A downside to camouflage is that you cannot use most **armor**, and only *Nano Weave* or integrated *Cybernetic Armor* work with Camouflage.

Likewise only **Small** melee weapons and Integrated weapon systems are viable when using Camouflage.

| Level | Effect                                                                             |
|:----- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Optical Camouflage. Short Duration when moving. Moderate Duration when stationary. |
| 2     | Thermoptic camouflage. Hide sounds of movement.                                    |
| 3     | Electromagnetic Camouflage. Does not cost any energy when staying still.           |


### Chronoflux

#Cybertech #Syndicate #Unsafe 

A dangerous modification to the frame's Energy Core that can create a temporal distortion centered on the frame, which alters the flow of time. It allows the individual to momentarily act faster and take more actions at a significant cost to themselves. Any damage taken by using the augment takes effect next round.

| Level | Effect                                                                                             |
|:----- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Take an additional action for **Short** Duration at cost of 1 energy and 1 Minor Wound to yourself. |
| 2     | Take 2 additional actions for total 2 Energy and a Major Wound                                     |
| 3     | Take 3 additional actions for 3 Energy and 2 Major wounds                                          |

### Coil interface

#Cybertech #Cyberweavers #Unsafe 
A system for remotely interfacing with any device that has any sort of circuitry, even without a software interface. Can also be used to inflict Feedback damage without hacking on cyborgs or synthetics and drain energy from electrical systems and cyborgs who lack the critical protection.

#Cybertech #RadicalX

It comes with a dead man's switch and the ability to trigger the device remotely by high-ranking operator. It is weapon whose delivery system is the unfortunate person picked for Crucible duty that day in the daily Radical X lottery where everyone loses.
