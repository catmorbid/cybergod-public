# 0x05 >> Persona

You are a soldier, an enhanced human working for one of the major factions. They pay your bills, you follow their orders, that's the deal. Why did you join? What did you do before? What are your personal goals and how do they align with your Faction?

Your mind is backed up in the infinite reaches of Cyberweb, and you have lived many lives and experienced many deaths. This is not your first rodeo, nor will it be your last. Each life lived leaves an **Engram**, a strong memory imprinted in your cybernetic soul. A powerful trauma, and anchor to ground you to reality, or a vice you can't seem to shake. Rebirth is traumatic and some say a piece of your soul dies each time you're *reborn*.
## Origin

Origin is you backstory and history. Where did you come from and how did you end up where you are now. You can pick one of the following, or roll a die, or write up something unique. Feel free to adjust the description to suit your character.

Origin does not have any defined mechanical effect, it's mostly there to add more depth to your character. GM may however give you information or some other advantage if a situation might benefit from your Origin.


1. **Slum kid**: You grew up in the Ground Zone, among the literal shadows of civilization. They promised eventually you could become a citizen, but years passed on hope waned and you ended up with the wrong crowd and got to experience first hand the quality of life the GZ has to offer. Finally, one day it just happened. You got in, citizen of the Commonwealth. You may leave the GZ but the GZ never leaves you.
2. **Child soldier**: You were an outsider, captured at young age and forced to serve as a soldier in some warlord's band of merry bandits. The Warlord was eventually defeated and you were captured and offered a chance at redemption, becoming part of the Commonwealth.
3. **Ex-Convict**: You have a troubled past, having been involved with criminals from young age, you knew not of another way to live your life. Eventually you were caught and thrown in the *Stasis*, part of your brain enslaved to serve the *Tri-Core*, all the while being re-educated in the virtual. You served your time and emerged re-educated, a promising candidate for the society. But civilian life did not suit you, and with all the conflict around you, you decided to take a stand, and joined a faction you believed would server your interests best.
4. **Prodigy**: You were a child prodigy, found at early age by the Commonwealth and brought into the society bypassing the usual bureaucratic hoops. They expected so much of you, what happened?
5. **Ancient Soldier**: You were found in an ancient cryogenic storage hidden from prying eyes. You were a soldier in the war of the past, a relic of ancient times. You were given a chance for a new life, but your training and memories of different times are rooted deep, and you have a hard time adjusting to the new world.
6. **Terrorist Victim**: You were a victim of a terror attack that took the life of your loved ones. You bear deep resentment towards the conductor of the attack, perhaps it was the Syndicate, Radical X, Order of the Void, or another, more marginal faction.
7. **Volunteer**: Your life was fine. You had a career, a family and friends. But deep down a dissatisfaction always churned inside. Then one day you decided to take action and volunteered. This would mean leaving your stable life behind and risking your humanity for a cause your firmly believed in. Your family, friends and ex-coworkers think you're insane leaving a life of abundance like this.
8. **Natural Born Cyborg**: Your life started with a tragedy that took your life. Somehow they managed to keep you alive long enough to upload your consciousness. You grew without a body, living great part of your life in virtual reality. At some point you received your first *frame* and could get finally experience the real world, but for you, the realspace always felt like an uncanny valley and you've had trouble fitting in ever since.
9. **Traditionalist:** You grew up in your chosen Faction. Your family was always involved, and so did you. You were indoctrinated from young age that his is the only for you, and you should serve and fulfill your duty.
10. **Opportunist**: You had a satisfying life and a successful career, but then you nearly died in a fatal accident. The surgeon knew what she was doing and managed to scavenge whatever was left of your brain and spine and give you a little life extension inside a stasis pod. You were technically alive, but there was very little of you actually left. When the offer came to give you a new life in a new body, in exchange for loyalty to a new employer, you took the opportunity. Such offers do not come often, what made you so special?
11. **Free Port Survivor**: You remember your home before the soldiers came in, before the Syndicate elites in black exoskeletons gunning down anyone who raised a hand, voice or an eyebrow. Before the anarchy and the fires. Before the gang wars and the extortion rackets that cost your family their life savings. You remember all the things your friends and family had to do just to survive - only to be gunned down in the street for forgetting to salute a drug kingpin's son. You remember hiding in a bomb shelter when the plasma fell. From a small window you watched as the sky was being lit in all the colors in the rainbow, raining indiscriminate death. Then one day the bombs died and you were alive. Emerging from the shelter you had chosen your side. Never again a victim.
12. **War Zone Refugee**: You grew up in a small agricultural community that provided food for the Commonwealth. You enjoyed the simple life. Then one day some soldiers came by, told you war was coming. Then the tanks rolled in, and next you knew it bombs fell. You were forced to escape together with your family and few others, but wherever you went it seemed the War Zone followed. You had to kill to survive, steal to eat and each day, while a step closer to the promised refuge, your group grew more and more desperate. United at first, the hardships took their toll and eventually they argued, and after blood was drawn, they parted and then you were only a few. You met other groups, some seemed friendly at first, but they weren't friends, they just wanted what was yours. A large convoy of refugees offered some protection, but wherever there's large number of people, there's corruption, violence and crime. Somehow you made it, but it felt like a lifetime ago since you left, and the person who finally arrived at the GZ wasn't the person who left their home all those months ago.

## Faction
Factions are listed on [04-factions](04-factions.md Factions>). Read through the factions and choose the faction your character swears allegiance to. Faction is an important factor in the game, and as different factions have conflicting agendas and are outright in war, you should make your faction choices together with player group and Game Master.

## Engrams

Engrams are strong memories deeply embedded in the character's digital psyche. Distant memories of past lives, vivid traumas and deep-rooted habits that make the character who they are, and define their humanity. Death and Rebirth are traumatizing and can result in the corruption of the Digital Psyche, represented by loss of Engrams. 

Write down 1-5 engrams, filling one of the five available slots. The number of engrams determines the character's experience where lower number means more experience. Since each death takes away a little bit, it is presumed that the longer you've been in the game, the more you've died and traumatized. You have a past, and it's not a nice one.

Each Engram adds a point of **Resolve** and some **Skill Points**, but will cost you **Upgrade Points**. The total number of Engrams also determines your **Stress Die**; less engrams you have, the less sensitive you become. What is there to fear when you have nothing to lose?

| Experience  | Engrams | Stress Save | Resolve | Aptitudes | Skills | Upgrades |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Relic       | 1       | Immune      | 1       | 4         | 12     | 8        |
| Veteran     | 2       | D12         | 2       | 5         | 10     | 6        |
| Experienced | 3       | D10         | 3       | 6         | 8      | 4        |
| Junior      | 4       | D8          | 4       | 7         | 6      | 2        |
| Fresh       | 5       | D6          | 5       | 8         | 4      | 0        |


**Engram Slots**
- **Aspiration**: A personal goal, something to strive towards. What drove you to this?
- **Anchor**: Something that grounds you to reality. Family, friends, loved ones, or things covered with emotion and remembrance.
- **Belief**: A strong belief, such as a philosophy or a spiritual world view. This is your moral compass, how you believe you should act in the world.
- **Fear**: Most people are afraid of something. Fear can be a weakness, but also a source of strength; something to overcome.
- **Vice**: A bad habit, an *urge*. A source of satisfaction.

### Corruption

Corruption represents permanent damage to the character's consciousness. Bad code, glitches in the OS, accumulation of errors due to constant reconstruction of the Mind after many deaths, or simply experiencing horrifying events that scar the psyche. While the system is designed to work with Cybernetic Brains and digital personalities, corruption does not require a cybernetic brain, and can be implemented even if the character has a fully natural frame. It can be used to represent various ailments of the mind, such as PTSD or alzheimer's disease. One way of gaining corruption is through severe Stress or gradual decay.

Corruption can be gained in a few ways, for example:
- Dying and being Reborn
- Being exposed to extreme stress or horrors
- Over-use of powerful combat drugs or other mind-altering substances
- Powerful and malevolent cyber weapons

Whenever you take a point of **Corruption**,  you must proceed to make a **Corruption Save** where you roll a D6 for each point of Corruption you have. If you fail, then one of your **Engrams** is corrupted. You must remove one **Engram** and you also lose the associated Resolve point and a single **Aptitude** point. You can then erase all accumulated Corruption points. This will however also increase the die for your Stress Save by one step.


> [!warning] The End
> If your last Engram is corrupted, you will cease to be a functional human. This is as close to real death as you can get here. Your character might continue to exist as an artificial intelligence inside a husk, a mere shell, or they may end up in a psychosis, culminating in a sudden violent killing spree. Or they can wander off into the unknown, never to be heard of again. You can decide what happens to your character after, but you can't play with them any longer. Write the final paragraph of their story. But that will be the end.

### Removing Corruption

Corruption can only be removed by undergoing extensive therapy. This will cost time, likely some Resources, and finally, as a token of the character's dedication to this process, some experience points. If all conditions are met, one point of corruption can be removed.
  - Pay experience cost for removing corruption (10 EXP)
  - Requires at least 4 therapy sessions.

### Decay Saves

Decay measures corruption on a much smaller scale, often as consequence of over-using drugs or powerful augments. Decay is not tracked, but rather whenever you take Decay, you must make a **Decay Save**.

Decay Saves use the die indicated by a **Safety** rating. If you fail the save, you will immediately take a point of corruption

## Aptitudes and Skills

Aptitude determines talent and basic ability at related skills. Each Aptitude has 3 skills underneath them.

Aptitudes are rated with a level from 0 to 3 and Skills are measured with a level from 0 to 4. Each Level in a Skill and relevant Aptitude adds one Die when making a **Skill Test**.


> [!info]
> Available Aptitude Points and Skill Points depend on your level of experience. You can allocate them freely on a 1:1 basis.

- **Tactics**: Combat awareness, tactical perception and the ability to react in combat.

### Education

Education in Commonwealth is free and offered to anyone. Education measures your general level of Education and academic knowledge and mindset. The skills listed under Education merely scratch the surface, and they are the ones considered "useful" in the context of this game, but you are free to invent an obscure academic specialization.

- **Stealth**: Remain undetected and perform various shadowy tasks.
- **Streetwise**: Knowledge of the criminal underground and etiquette among them. Street awareness and knowing how to avoid trouble.

### Technical

Technical Aptitude defines your understanding of software and hardware and how they create the everyday technology all around you. Majority of the hardware used in modern technology is so complicated and intricate that they can only be manufactured and maintained by specialized assembly systems. The human part of the technology lies in understanding the core principles of the hardware and the software that manages it. You design and the machines create.
- **Design**: Design technology, software, virtual worlds.
- **Hacking**: Find creative ways to abuse systems to bypass security measures or make them do something they were not intended for. Just don't expect a long-term solution for a problem.
- **Troubleshooting**: Problem solving and troubleshooting, the ability to fix bugs and glitches between software and hardware. Fix it if it's broken.

## Resolve

[#Engrams](#Engrams) determine the character's humanity, or how much is left of it. It also affects their **Resolve**, which is a pool of resources that can be spent to get out of sticky situations and invoke internal reserves of strength at times of desperation. It's a combination of persistence, luck and force of will.

Resolve can be used in the following ways:

- **Spend** Resolve to gain a **Re-roll** *after* rolling the dice on *any* test.
- **Burn** Resolve *before* rolling the dice to gain to automatically succeed at the test. You can still roll for any bonus effects. If a test is impossible, you cannot succeed even with resolve.

If the above base uses are not enough, Game Masters are encouraged to invent additional uses for Resolve and player can always *suggest* spending or burning resolve to survive a tricky situation.

### Refreshing Resolve

**Spent** Resolve is **Refreshed** by one point at the start of each game session. Resolve is usually fully refreshed after some [Downtime](<#Structure of play>), once the character has had some time to relax.

A **burned** resolve is much more difficult to Refresh. This is generally up to the GM how often they allow refreshing burned resolve. E.g. long downtime or going on a vacation or achieving a significant story goal may refresh burned resolve, to give a few examples. If the character has burned all their resolve, the may be forced on a leave of absence until they recover some.

### Improving the character
You will be awarded Progression and Merits as you play the game and complete missions. Once you accumulate enough, you can spend them to improve your character. You can mark them on your character sheet. For more information on Progression and Merits see [10 Gamemastering#Progression](10-gm.md#Progression Gamemastering#Progression>) and [10 Gamemastering#Merits](10-gm.md#Merits Gamemastering#Merits>).
